/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to program your robot to drive field relative.  This means
 * that the robot drives the direction you push the joystick regardless of the current orientation
 * of the robot.
 *
 * This OpMode assumes that you have four mecanum wheels each on its own motor named:
 *   front_left_motor, front_x_motor, back_left_motor, back_x_motor
 *
 *   and that the left motors are flipped such that when they turn clockwise the wheel moves backwards
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
